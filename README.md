## 🔬 Projects

1. **Movie Recommendation System**  
   - Engineered a high-performance Movie Recommendation System using Python and Streamlit, the system processes a dataset of over 4,800 movies and delivers five personalized recommendations with an average query response time of under 1.5 seconds.
   - Optimized API Integration & Data Processing: Integrated the TMDb API to dynamically retrieve movie details (posters, genres, overviews) with a 95% success rate, leveraging a precomputed similarity matrix that improved recommendation relevance by approximately 85%.
  
2. **GenAI LinkedIn Post Generator**
   - Developed a LinkedIn post generator using LLaMA 3 (Groq API), LangChain, and Streamlit, with a RandomForest model (R² ≈ 0.90) predicting engagement from NLP features (TextBlob, pandas)

3. **Breast Cancer Detection Application**  
   - Created a logistic regression model in **Python** with **Scikit-learn**, achieving a **96% accuracy** rate.  
   - Illustrated end-to-end project steps-data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and minimal UI for inference.
